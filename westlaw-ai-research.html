          Overview
        </h2>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
          Westlaw is a legal research platform used by legal professionals to access case law, statutes, and legal commentary. Recently, it faced disruption from AI tools that can rapidly generate legal summaries, conduct case analysis, and automate complex research tasks.

          The Challenge
        </h2>
        <p class="lead mb-5">
          Lawyers often face significant challenges when researching case law due to the sheer volume and complexity of legal information. Navigating outdated interfaces, inconsistent search results, and dense legal language can make it difficult to quickly identify relevant precedents. Time constraints, pressure for accuracy, and the need to interpret subtle legal nuances further complicate the process—especially when stakes are high and cases hinge on finding the right supporting authority.

            AI has been designed to support—not replace—legal professionals in their decision-making. Lawyers retained full control, with the ability to review, edit, or reject AI-generated suggestions before incorporating them into their work.
